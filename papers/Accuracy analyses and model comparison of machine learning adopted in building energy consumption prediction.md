# Accuracy analyses and model comparison of machine learning adopted in building energy consumption prediction

## Engineering methods

Common practice currently is to estimate the energy usage of a building using "engineering methods" which involve super complex equations and physics principles. They involve some apriori reasoning about the laws governing energy usage in the building.

## Statistical methods

These are purely empirical, they make future usage estimations based on past observations (for a given building or similar buildings).
